# A Toy HTTP/1.1 Server

This is just another Toy HTTP/1.1 Server for the fun of it. It's a toy project to learn more about how HTTP works and
Java 21.  
Currently only support GET from a root directory.
Some of the codes are written with the help of GitHub Copilot, don't be surprised if you see some weird code.
